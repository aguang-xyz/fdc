# Test Cases

Briefly, the test cases are separeted into three folders:

  * io: Basic test cases to cover the functions of input and output.
  * algorithm: Serveral test cases in small size, which we can figure out the
      result easily, to avoid obvious erros.
  * dataset: Run a sort of quite big datasets automatically to evaluate the
      execution time of algorithms in big-size datasets.
